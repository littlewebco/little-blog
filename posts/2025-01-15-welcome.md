# Welcome to Little Cloud Blog

This is your first blog post. You can edit this file directly or use the Decap CMS admin interface at `/admin` on your main site.

## Getting Started

This repository stores all blog posts as Markdown files. Each post should:

- Have frontmatter with at least `title`, `date`, and `author`
- Use standard Markdown syntax for the content
- Be named in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`

## Writing Posts

You can write posts using:

- **Headings** for structure
- **Bold** and *italic* text for emphasis
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Links and images
- Code blocks

### Example Code Block

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

## Next Steps

- Edit this post or create a new one
- The main site will pull these posts during build
- Posts are automatically versioned through Git

Happy blogging!
